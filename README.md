Our application Fuel Buddy servers to accomplish the goal of sharing fuel amongst people of Sri Lanka as 
per each individual’s need in this current time of crisis. The problem intended to solve from our 
application is the Sri Lankan fuel crisis and different individuals needing different amount of fuel as per 
their job. If a certain person has excess fuel quota, they won’t be using that week, they can sell that fuel 
to a person wanting that fuel as an additional income. Also, if someone is willing, the excess fuel can be 
donated to people in sections such as healthcare.
The main goal of the application is to distribute fuel to those who need it, especially drivers and 
healthcare workers. To accomplish that, we intend to provide a platform where extra fuel can be sold 
and bought. Users must be registered to be eligible to access our services to prevent any fraudulent 
activity.<br> 
Benefits: <br>
• Users can easily access to sell or buy additional fuel according to their needs.<br>
• Users can purchase fuel according to their needs.<br>
• Instead of wasting fuel, it can be used by someone who needs the fuel.<br>
• Users can sell excess fuel to earn additional income. <br>
